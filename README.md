#  **CalmNest 🤍** 
### ✨ Where your mind finds comfort ✨
## Overview 

This is a chatbot designed to provide mental health support to students by engaging in meaningful conversations with users. It uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning models,LSTM to capture dependencies and to classify user intents and generate appropriate responses. The chatbot is built with TensorFlow, Keras, and Streamlit for a smooth and interactive user experience.

## 📂 Data

✦ [intent.json](intent.json) is used to pretrain the chatbot.

## 📌Features

✦ Conversational AI: Understands user inputs and provides relevant responses.

✦ Intent Recognition🎯: Uses a trained deep learning model to classify user queries.

✦ Predefined & Generated Responses📝: Uses predefined responses where available and generates responses for unseen queries.

✦ Interactive UI using Streamlit.

✦ Deep Learning Model🔍: Implements LSTMs and Embeddings for text classification.

✦ Chat History Tracking: Keeps track of past conversations within the session.

✦ Easy Deployment: Can be deployed on cloud platforms.
